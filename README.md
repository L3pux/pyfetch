I'm not a programmer and I only started learning to code a while ago, I though that making a fetch project is a good idea and I wanted to share is :)
# Usage:
to use it simply download the pyfetch file and run it 
    $ python pyfetch.py
# Notes:
When I made it I didn't made it for people to use instead of other fetch programs so it's not finished and have lot of problems, like:
* It'll only display apt and pacman packages
* It'll only display resolutionv for xorg because it is using xrander to find the monitor info
And I've only tested it on ubuntu and EndeavourOS so don't expect it to work perfectly

# requirements
* colorama
  $ pip install colorama
